# vintagetype

This is a personal project, experimenting with web typography based on vintage type samples — old advertisements, packaging, hotel matchbooks, postcards, etc — and recreating them for the web.

In my opinion, typography and design have gotten boring as we adopt the “less is more” philosophy. I’ve always been a fan of “more is more” and there is something captivating about the way we used to arrange our type, sometimes bordering on incoherent and disorderly — but undeniably interesting and beautiful in its own right. This quote by [Bethany Heck](http://heckhouse.com/) in an essay on [New Traditionalism](
http://heckhouse.com/new-traditionalism/) sums it up well: 
>"Vintage designs have reminded designers to take risks, to mix more typefaces and break more rules.” 

Well, who isn’t interested in risk-taking and rule-breaking, especially in the usually non-life-threatening realm of design?

For the best coherency and to show how much you can do with so little (and to prevent the world’s longest page load)  I chose a few modern typefaces that I felt could illustrate the whole range of samples well enough.
